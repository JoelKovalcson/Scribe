## Description

The foundation for this project was provided by an online bootcamp for [Full-Stack Development](https://bootcamps.vanderbilt.edu/coding/online/landing/). 

This project focused on creating an Express.js application hosted on Heroku to serve a frontend with a linked backend.

The requirements for the project were as follows:
* Use `Express.js`
* Host the application on Heroku
* Create an API that has the following routes
  * GET `/api/notes`
    * Return all notes as JSON
  * POST `/api/notes`
    * Add a note to the DB
  * *BONUS* DELETE `/api/notes/:id`
    * Remove a note from the DB
  * GET `*`
    * Serve index.html
  * GET `/notes`
    * Serve notes.html
* Link your Express.js application to the provided material under the `public/` folder

## What I Did

I started this project by setting up `Express.js` and some basic route outlining. After that I setup Heroku and began working on each route endpoint. I studied the provided material in the `public/` folder to make sure I created the endpoints properly, then tested until I got them working.
